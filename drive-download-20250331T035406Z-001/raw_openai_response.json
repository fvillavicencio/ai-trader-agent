  "justification": "The decision to 'Watch for Better Price Action' is based on the current market environment characterized by high volatility, a flat yield curve, and significant geopolitical risks. The mixed analyst sentiment, with some seeing opportunities in specific sectors while others advise caution, further supports a cautious approach. The fundamental metrics of key stocks show a mixed picture, with some companies like Microsoft showing potential for growth at a reasonable price, while others lack detailed financial ratios, making it difficult to assess their value accurately. The macroeconomic factors, including a flat yield curve and increasing inflation, suggest uncertainty about future economic conditions and potential for tighter monetary policy, which could impact market sentiment negatively. Therefore, waiting for clearer market signals before making any trading decisions is advisable.",
