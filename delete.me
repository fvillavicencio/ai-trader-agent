We already got the current rate and the FOMC meeting schedule piece covered, so no need to touch those at all, simply add additional functions to @fetchFedPolicy.gs to tackle these suggestions:
Below is one way you can set up your system. We‚Äôll break this into three parts:

1. Real-Time Sources
a. Effective Fed Funds Rate
Use the FRED API, which is free (if you already have an API key) to get the latest observations for the effective federal funds rate. For example, query the series FEDFUNDS to get current and recent rate values.

b. Fed Policy Forward Guidance
A reliable‚Äîand free‚Äîsource for forward guidance is the Federal Reserve‚Äôs own website. In particular, you can retrieve and parse content from the press releases or statements pages. For instance, you might scrape https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases.htm to grab the text from the most recent guidance. (Keep in mind the page structure may require adjustments to your parsing rules over time.)

c. Fed Funds Futures / Rate Change Probabilities
Data for Fed Funds futures, which market participants use to gauge the probability of rate changes, is available from several vendors. Although many are subscription‚Äëbased, one free approach is to scrape the relevant section on the CME Group‚Äôs website. The CME page (for example, https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/fed-funds/30-day-federal-funds.html) displays quotes that can be interpreted (with some work) into rate change probabilities. (Keep in mind that free scraping may be subject to website changes and terms of service.)

2. Approach to Retrieving the Data
FRED API (Effective Rate):
Use Google Apps Script‚Äôs UrlFetchApp to query the FRED endpoint. Parse the JSON response to extract the latest rate observations.

Federal Reserve Press Releases (Forward Guidance):
Use UrlFetchApp again to fetch the HTML content from the Fed‚Äôs press release page. Then, use a method (such as a regular expression match or an HTML parser) to extract the block of text that reflects the Fed‚Äôs current forward guidance.

CME Group Page (Fed Funds Futures):
Fetch the HTML content from the CME Group Fed Funds page. Then extract key numbers (such as the futures price and/or calculated probabilities). Because the actual calculations for market-implied probabilities are often based on proprietary formulations, you might have to compute the percentages by comparing quoted futures prices to the current Fed funds effective rate.
For example, if you pull the price 
ùëÉ
P for the 30-day Fed Funds futures, one common interpretation is that the implied rate is 
100
‚àí
ùëÉ
100‚àíP (when the price is quoted as 100 minus the rate). Market probability splits (up, unchanged, down) could then be approximated by comparing how far 
100
‚àí
ùëÉ
100‚àíP is from the current rate. (Note that the exact formula or probabilities may vary by vendor.)

3. Example Google Apps Script Implementation
Below is a sample Google Apps Script that attempts to combine these three data sources. Modify the parsing parts as needed to handle changes in the page formats or to reflect your exact probability‚Äìcalculation methodology.

Based on recent Fed communications, the Committee is focused on balancing inflation concerns with economic growth.
The Fed remains data-dependent in its approach to future rate decisions.

Explanation
FRED API (getCurrentFedRate):
The script calls FRED‚Äôs API for the FEDFUNDS series, ordering the data in descending order. It extracts the two most recent observations and rounds them to two decimals.

Forward Guidance (getFedForwardGuidance):
The script fetches the Fed‚Äôs press releases page. A regular expression attempts to grab some text from the first press release block. In practice, you might need to adjust this regex or use an HTML parser library if available within GAS.

Fed Funds Futures (getFedFundsFuturesProbabilities):
This function scrapes the CME Group page for the 30-day Fed Funds futures and applies a basic regex (which you will need to adjust based on the actual page structure). It calculates an ‚Äúimplied rate‚Äù from a quoted futures price. Then it crudely computes rate change probabilities based on the difference between the implied rate and the current Fed rate.
(Note: In reality, calculating these probabilities requires more rigorous methods, and many vendors use proprietary models.)

FOMC Meetings (getFOMCMeetingSchedule):
The script also scrapes the Fed‚Äôs meeting calendar and extracts meeting dates using a simple regular expression. You may need to tailor this function to account for your specific display needs or any changes in the HTML.

Final Notes
Adjust for Page Changes:
The Fed and CME websites may update their page structures. Be prepared to modify your regex or parsing logic as needed.

API Limitations & Terms of Use:
Ensure that your use of scraping and APIs complies with the terms of use of the websites and data vendors.

Accuracy of Probabilities:
The simple calculation for futures probabilities shown above is for illustration. For accurate market-implied probabilities, you may need to integrate with a dedicated financial data vendor API.

This script provides a starting point. You can further refine the extraction, add error handling, and adjust calculations to suit your reporting needs.
