This ongoing conflict has led to higher prices, contributing to increased inflation rates globally[1]. The war has particularly affected European energy markets and global commodity prices, with emerging market stocks experiencing sharper declines during international military conflicts (average monthly drop of 5 percentage points)[3].\n\nImpact Rating: 8/10\nRegions Most Affected: Europe, Global Energy Markets\nSectors: Energy, Agriculture, Defense\n\n**Israel-Hamas War**\n\nThe conflict between Israel and Hamas remains a significant source of regional instability in the Middle East. This has implications for energy security and has contributed to inflationary pressures[1]. The situation has been further complicated by developments in Syria, where the fall of Assad's regime to the US-designated terrorist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham has raised new concerns about the spread of political jihadism and terrorism risks in the region and beyond[5].\n\nImpact Rating: 7/10\nRegions Most Affected: Middle East, Global Energy Markets\nSectors: Energy, Defense, Transportation\n\n**US-China Relations**\n\nThe relationship between the United States and China continues to influence global sourcing patterns and tariff costs[1]. In 2025, globalization has become more fractious and uncertain as the US pursues a potentially more protectionist economic approach[2]. This tension is creating a more \"multi-aligned\" backdrop that increases the likelihood of geopolitical \"surprises\" and a wider range of potential outcomes across the global landscape[5].\n\nImpact Rating: 8/10\nRegions Most Affected: North America, Asia-Pacific\nSectors: Technology, Manufacturing, Trade\n\n**Cyber and Infrastructure Threats**\n\nCyber and sabotage attacks on US and other Western nations' critical infrastructure remain an under-the-radar risk and a key focus for policymakers[5]. These threats pose significant risks to financial stability and can trigger sharp market reactions due to their unique nature, rare occurrence, and uncertain duration and scope[3].\n\nImpact Rating: 6/10\nRegions Most Affected: Advanced Economies, Critical Infrastructure\nSectors: Technology, Utilities, Financial Services\n\n**Rising Defense Spending**\n\nCountries worldwide are boosting defense spending and rebuilding arsenals depleted by wars in Ukraine and the Middle East. This trend is creating structural and long-term tailwinds for various national security themes, including legacy defense and defense innovation[5]. The increased government spending on defense may also contribute to sovereign risk premiums, particularly in emerging market economies[3].\n\nImpact Rating: 7/10\nRegions Most Affected: Global, particularly NATO countries\nSectors: Defense, Aerospace, Technology",
