      "description": "Ongoing conflicts in the Middle East—including instability in Syria, tensions involving Iran, and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict—have heightened concerns over potential oil supply disruptions. While recent escalations, such as Iranian missile attacks and threats to regional oil infrastructure, have triggered the sharpest oil price rise in two years, overall market reaction has been more muted than in previous crises. Analysts note that the risk premium in oil prices has increased, but actual supply disruptions remain limited so far, with OPEC+ production and global oversupply helping to stabilize prices. The situation remains fluid, with the potential for further volatility if the conflict widens or directly impacts major oil producers.",
