      "description": "Renewed Russian missile strikes on Ukrainian infrastructure on May 10, 2025 have disrupted critical gas transit routes, occurring just days after the European Commission published its Roadmap towards ending Russian energy imports.

The timing is particularly significant as the EU faces increased vulnerability following the cessation of Russian gas transit through Ukraine since January 1, 2025.",

      "description": "On May 12, 2025, China imposed new export controls on seven key rare earth elements—samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium, and yttrium—requiring exporters to obtain special licenses. These minerals are critical for manufacturing semiconductors, electric vehicle (EV) batteries, and defense technologies. The move is widely seen as a response to recent US tariff increases and is expected to disrupt global supply chains, particularly in the technology and automotive sectors. The restrictions are not a total ban but introduce significant uncertainty and potential delays in supply, especially for US and allied firms[1][2][3][4].",
