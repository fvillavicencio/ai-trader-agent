# Ghost Publisher Lambda - Fixed Version

This is a fixed version of the Ghost Publisher Lambda function that addresses the 503 Service Unavailable errors when publishing posts to Ghost.

## What's Fixed

1. **Visibility Fallback Mechanism**: The Lambda function now tries multiple visibility settings if one fails:
   - First attempts with `members` visibility
   - Falls back to `public` visibility if `members` fails

2. **Enhanced Error Handling**: More detailed error logging to help diagnose API issues

3. **Robust Retry Logic**: Each visibility setting is tried multiple times with exponential backoff

## Deployment Instructions

1. Navigate to the `ghost-publisher-lambda-fixed` directory:
   ```
   cd "/Users/frankvillavicencio/Documents/Development/git-fix-temp/Market Pulse Daily/Ghost-Post-Template/ghost-publisher-lambda-fixed"
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a deployment package:
   ```
   npm run zip
   ```

4. Upload the generated `ghost-publisher-lambda.zip` file to AWS Lambda:
   - Go to the AWS Lambda console
   - Select your existing function
   - In the "Code" tab, click "Upload from" and select ".zip file"
   - Upload the `ghost-publisher-lambda.zip` file
   - Click "Save"

## Testing

After deploying the updated function, you can test it with the same input as before. The function will:

1. First try to create the post with `members` visibility
2. If that fails with a 503 error, it will try with `public` visibility
3. Detailed logs will be available in CloudWatch

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues after deploying this fixed version:

1. Check the CloudWatch logs for detailed error information
2. Verify that your Ghost API key has the necessary permissions
3. Check if the Ghost API is experiencing other issues or rate limits
4. Consider contacting Ghost support if the problem persists

## Note on Ghost API

The 503 errors might indicate temporary issues with the Ghost API itself. This fixed version implements fallback mechanisms to handle such situations, but persistent 503 errors could indicate broader issues with the Ghost service that might require contacting their support team.
