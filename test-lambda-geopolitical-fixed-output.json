The forward P/E ratio of 23.28 suggests overvaluation, especially with geopolitical tensions and tariff impacts weighing on sentiment. Analysts express caution, with concerns about the sustainability of recent gains and potential downside risks. The USD is weakening while gold is rising, indicating a risk-averse environment. Given these factors, a cautious approach is recommended, with a focus on monitoring for better price action and considering selling calls to capitalize on high volatility.",
