  "justification": "The current market environment is characterized by extreme fear and uncertainty. The CNN Fear and Greed Index is at 20, indicating 'Extreme Fear', which historically can signal a potential buying opportunity. However, several factors suggest caution: 1) The 10-year Treasury yield has increased despite Fed rate cuts, indicating economic uncertainty and potentially fewer rate cuts than expected. 2) Inflation expectations have risen. 3) Geopolitical risks are escalating with new tariffs and shifting international relations. 4) The upcoming FOMC meeting could bring policy changes. Given these mixed signals and heightened uncertainty, it's prudent to watch for better price action before making significant moves. Investors should closely monitor economic data, Fed communications, and geopolitical developments for clearer directional cues."
