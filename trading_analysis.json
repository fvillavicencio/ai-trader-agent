  "justification": "The current market environment is characterized by mixed signals and elevated uncertainty. The CNN Fear & Greed Index at 20 indicates extreme fear, which historically can present buying opportunities. However, this is countered by a still-elevated VIX and ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical risks. Treasury yields suggest continued economic concerns, with the yield curve remaining inverted. While some sectors like financials appear attractive, others like technology still show signs of overvaluation. Given the upcoming FOMC meeting and CPI data release, which could significantly impact market direction, it's prudent to watch for better price action before making major investment decisions. Investors should closely monitor these events and look for clearer signals or more attractive entry points before committing capital."
