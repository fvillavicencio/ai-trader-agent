  "summary": "The geopolitical landscape shows signs of cautious diplomatic progress amid persistent regional tensions. The most significant development is the recent US-China trade agreement reducing previously inflated tariffs, with US tariffs on Chinese goods dropping from 145% to 30% and China cutting tariffs on US exports by 10%. This 90-day temporary reduction represents a potential thawing in relations that had reached near-embargo levels, particularly affecting technology hardware and cross-border M&A activities. However, this progress remains fragile as underlying strategic competition continues, especially regarding Taiwan and semiconductor supply chains.\n\nMeanwhile, the Russia-Ukraine conflict enters its fourth year with intensified fighting in eastern regions and increased Western military aid commitments, straining European energy security and defense budgets. In the Middle East, Israel-Hamas hostilities have evolved into a broader regional conflict involving Iran-backed proxies, threatening oil transportation routes and global energy prices. These conflicts are driving increased defense spending globally, benefiting defense contractors but pressuring government fiscal positions.\n\nEmerging market instability presents another concern, with political transitions in key economies like Brazil and India creating policy uncertainty for investors. Climate-related disruptions to agriculture and shipping are exacerbating food security concerns and supply chain vulnerabilities. Together, these factors create a complex risk environment for markets, with particular exposure in energy, defense, technology, and emerging market sectors.",
