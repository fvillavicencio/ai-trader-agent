The most prominent of these involve the US, Russia, and China, with issues ranging from territorial disputes, threats of annexation, and disagreements over international organizations and defense systems. The situation in Venezuela has also been flagged as a high risk for American travelers due to crime, civil unrest, and lack of consular support.
