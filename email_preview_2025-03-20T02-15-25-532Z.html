      <div class="section">
        <div class="section-title">1. The last known CNN Fear & Greed Index value of 20 indicates extreme fear in the market [2][7], which could present buying opportunities for contrarian investors. However, without recent trend data, it's unclear if this sentiment is improving or worsening.

2. The geopolitical tensions mentioned, including US tariffs on Canada and Mexico [2], could continue to impact market sentiment negatively. However, the full effects of these actions may not yet be reflected in market prices.

3. The lack of current data on Treasury yields, VIX, and commodity prices prevents a comprehensive analysis of market risk and economic outlook.

Given these factors, the most prudent course of action is to watch for better price action. Investors should wait for more clear and recent data before making significant trading decisions. It's crucial to monitor upcoming economic reports, Fed statements, and geopolitical developments for potential market-moving events.
